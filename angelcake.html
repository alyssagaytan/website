		     <center><h1>Angel Cake</h1></center>


<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Granulated Sugar: The recipe begins with granulated sugar. Pulse it in a food processor to create superfine sugar. Superfine sugar’s granules are the best size to provide optimal structure for angel food cake. It’s not as coarse as granulated sugar and not as fine as confectioners’ sugar. Granulated sugar is simply too coarse, while confectioners’ sugar dissolves too quickly in the egg whites.</li>
<li>Cake Flour: Cake flour is a low protein flour and yields a tender angel food cake. Do not use all-purpose flour because the cake will taste like white bread…! In a pinch, you can use this cake flour substitute. But real cake flour is ideal.</li>
<li>Salt: Adds flavor.</li>
<li>Egg Whites: You’ll notice there’s no baking powder or baking soda. The egg whites are actually the sole leavening ingredient providing all the cake’s rise. Use freshly separated eggs because they aerate the best. Carton egg whites or egg whites that have been frozen won’t expand as much during the whipping process, which will negatively affect the rise of your cake. You’ll have a lot of leftover egg yolks, so make some lemon curd and serve it with the cake!</li>
<li>Cream of Tartar: Cream of tartar is an acid and stabilizes the whipped egg whites, just as it does in my chocolate swirled meringue cookies too. Without it, the cake would collapse. Other acids, such as lemon juice, can work but they aren’t nearly as effective. Cream of tartar is found in the spice aisle and is actually a common baking ingredient. I have many recipes calling for it!</li>
                     <li>Vanilla Extract: Adds flavor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
                     <li>Pulse the granulated sugar into superfine sugar. Use a food processor or blender.</li>
<li>Set 1 cup of the superfine sugar aside. You’ll add it to the egg whites.</li>
<li>Add cake flour and salt to food processor. Pulse them with the remaining sugar. This aerates the dry ingredients.</li>
                     <li>Beat egg whites and cream of tartar together. Beat on medium-low speed until foamy.</li>
<li>Slowly add 1 cup of superfine sugar. Turn the mixer up to medium-high and pour in the superfine sugar you set aside.</li>
<li>Beat into soft peaks. Whip the egg whites, cream of tartar, and superfine sugar into soft and lofty peaks. This takes at least 5 minutes. After that, add the vanilla.</li>
<li>Sift and fold in dry ingredients. In 3 additions, sift and fold in the dry ingredients.
<li>Pour/spread batter into a tube pan. Do not grease the tube pan. Greasing the pan causes the batter to slip down the sides, preventing it from properly rising. If you already greased it, wash and wipe it completely clean.</li>
<li>Bake at 325°F (163°C). A higher temperature won’t properly cook the cake.</li>
<li>Cool upside down on a wire rack. If cooled upright, the cake’s own weight will crush itself. Cool it upside-down on a cooling rack so it holds its shape and air can reach it.</li>
<li>Run a thin knife around the edges to release. Tap the pan on the counter a few times to help loosen the cake, too.</li>
<li>Slice with a serrated knife. A regular sharp knife squishes the cake.Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possible.</li></li>
